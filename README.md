# Game_Jam-Final_Project
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2022

## Theme
Crunch Time

## Game Play
Objective
Match 3 or more pieces to get a high score in 30 seconds.

## Impediments
Coding the timer to not only show up on the HUD but also to countdown the 30 seconds.
The time limit for the project, to fully polish and add everything we would have liked to for the game to make it as nice as possible.

## Implementation
We templated a match three exercise for our game to combat the amount of coding we would've needed to do.
We created new asset sprites, music, and used a freeuse background adding them to the game.
Created a timer for the HUD to show how long the game would go on for.
Created an end game screen with the options to restart or exit game.
